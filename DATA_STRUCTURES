glutil can perform IO operations on glFTPd binary logs (any vanilla 
binary file you can find in /logs folder), shared mem segment containing
online users info, or the filesystem, based on advanced filtering 
methods. Extensive formatting options are available, output can be
passed along to the shell or written to stdout (see -exec[v] and -print[f]).
This document contains a full list of data fields that are available.

Fields are referenced using static variable names and accepted by 
--[i]regex[i], --[i]match, --[i]lom, --sort, -exec family instructions 
and -print[f]  (see --help)

Mind, that whenever passing arguments to -exec[v] or -print[f], 
{} enclosures to be used around variables (e.g. {dir}, {time}, ...) 

* NOTE: As of 1.9-34, data log field names are guaranteed to be the
  same when reading and writing. For instance, filtering by a specific
  field (regex,lom,..) takes the same field name argument as textform
  datalog records (used when injecting data into logs, -z).
  Some field names were changed.
  
* NOTE: Fields are added all the time, check CHANGELOG or commit
  history to see when they were added, except when using the latest
  version
