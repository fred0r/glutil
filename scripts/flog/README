These scripts are used for building/searching a special
binary log which holds file information. The log may be
built passively (see 'filelog-rebuild' macro) or actively
by hooking the mk_index.sh script to ftp STOR commands.

See installation instructions below;

REQUIREMENTS:

	* glutil_2.4.5 or later, compiled for a chrooted environment


INSTALLATION:

	* Compile and install the latest chrooted version of glutil:
	
		make clean
		./configure --prefix /<glroot> --enable-chroot-ownbin
		make install
		
	* Ensure that /tmp folders exists in /<glroot and has proper permissions:
	
		mkdir -p /<glroot>/tmp
		chmod 1777 /<glroot>/tmp
		
	* Ensure that '/<glroot>/ftp-data/glutil/db/' exists and has proper
	  permissions:
	  
	  	mkdir -p /<glroot>/ftp-data/glutil/db/
	  	chmod 777 /<glroot>/ftp-data/glutil/db/
	  	
	  Choose a different path where log will be stored by editing
	  FILE_LOG_PATH variable in both .sh files
	  
	* Install the scripts:
	
		mkdir -p /<glroot>/bin/scripts/flog
		cp fsearch.sh mk_index.sh un_index.sh stack_exec.sh /<glroot>/bin/scripts/flog
		chmod +x /<glroot>/bin/scripts/flog/*.sh
		
	* Configure site commands and STOR hooks (in glftpd.conf):
	
		cscript			STOR			post 	/bin/scripts/flog/mk_index.sh
		cscript			DELE            post    /bin/scripts/flog/stack_exec.sh
		
		site_cmd		FSEARCH			EXEC 	/bin/scripts/flog/fsearch.sh
		custom-fsearch	!8      		*
		
	* Configure 'stack_exec.sh' script to execute 'un_index.sh' and
	  whatever other script that is already hooked to DELE command:
	  
	  	CHAIN=(				
			"/bin/scripts/flog/un_index.sh"
			"/bin/something.."
			"/bin/someotherthing.."
		)
		
	  Read description inside 'stack_exec.sh'
	  
	* Build the initial index using 'filelog-rebuild' macro in 'macros.glutil',
	  make sure to have the latest version of the file, then run:
	
		glutil -m filelog-rebuild --altlog /<glroot>/ftp-data/glutil/db/filelog

USAGE:

	SITE FSEARCH <query>
