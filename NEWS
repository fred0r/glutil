 * 8/7/2014 (2.3.19_b2)
 
    Added features which allow automated rebuilds of the dupefile, see
    <dupefile-rebuild> and <dupefile-rebuild> macros (macros.glutil).
    
    Mind that glutil binary must also be updated.

 * 19/6/2014 (2.3.19)

    Major issue in 2.3.18 was fixed, in certain cases blank directory names were written
    in during dirlog rebuild mode.

 * 19/6/2014 (2.3.18_b1)
 
    Automake: --enable-precheck does not disable regular (or chrooted) binary build
 
 * 26/5/2014 (2.3.17_beta)
 
    Now supports gzip compressed data sources, usefull for large
    imdb/tvrage logs
 
 * 25/5/2014 (2.3.17_beta)
    Added a way to accumulate (add-up) any integer/floating point field across the whole
    data source or just a part of it. For example, directory sizes from the dirlog can be
    added up and stored into one of the available accumulators (see DATA_STRUCTURES).
    
    Filters are respected, anything not passing through will be ignored.
    
    How and where a value accumulates, is defined via a LOM filter hook;
    Directives within a LOM command scope, which define the accumulation 
    process, are not treated as filters and are ignored.
    
    Usage examples:
    
	  Count up folder files and sizes from all dirlog records:
    
		glutil -d --ilom "u64glob10 += size && u64glob11 += files" --postexec "echo 'Total size: {u64glob10} bytes, files: {u64glob11}'" --silent
    	
	  Increment by one for each record matched (regex and LOM filters applied):
   	  
		glutil -d --ilom "u64glob7 += 1" --iregex "a" --ilom "size != 0 && files != 0" --postexec "echo 'Results: {u64glob7}'"
		
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
    Added -mlist, displays all available macros, with descriptions (if present)
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Added dirlog-record-stats, imdb-record-avgstats, imdb-record-totalstats and imdb-record-stats
    macros to macros.glutil.
    
    See descriptions by running:
    
    	glutil -mlist | egrep "^(imdb|dirlog)-record"
 
 * 23/5/2014
    Changed behaviour: dirlog rebuild does not skip empty directories unconditionally.
    Instead, specifiy appropriate filtering parameters (e.g. --lom "size = 0 && files = 0")
    at the command line when running a dirlog rebuld (-r).
 
 * 17/5/2014
    Dump operations (-d, -n, ..) and filesystem traversal (-x) no longer output 
    statistics by default (use '--stats' to revert to old behaviour)
  
 * 5/1/2014
    Changed option name for full dirlog rebuild from '-f' to '--full' (2.3.10)
 
 * 6/12/2013
    Converted project to automake and fixed a bug (see ChangeLog)
