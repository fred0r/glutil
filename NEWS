 * 12/10/2014 (2.4.11)
 
 	Comparison logics operators (and/or) behaviour has changed (never worked properly) and
 	POSIX compilant negator options were implemented (old style [i]<lom|regex|..> has been
 	removed), this required some of the scripts and the macros.glutil file to be updated.
 	
 	The files affected by these changes are:
 	
 	 	- killslow.sh
		- macros.glutil
 		- imdb_get.sh
 		- tvrage_get.sh
 		- gb_get.sh
		
	There is no backwards compatibility, users updating to glutil 2.4.11 or newer should
	update the scripts too, or they will not work properly.
	
	See --help for more info on filtering options.

 * 10/10/2014 (2.4.9_b9)
 
 	Added 'gfind', a filesystem search tool with all of glutil's filtering and other relevant
 	functionality. 
 	Note that filtering option names have been inverted, for example, '--iregex' has
 	the same effect as '--regex' in the default glutil tool;
 	Since the nature of this tool is to search stuff out, default (non-inverted) filter options 
 	do matching as opposed to filtering (normal glutil behaviour).
 	
 	To compile, configure your build with:
 	
 		./configure --enable-gfind --prefix /usr
 		
	Make sure to 'make clean' first.	
 
 * 8/7/2014 (2.3.19_b2)
 
 	Added features which allow automated rebuilds of the dupefile, see
 	<dupefile-rebuild> and <dupefile-rebuild> macros (macros.glutil).
 	
 	Mind that glutil binary must also be updated.

 * 19/6/2014 (2.3.19)

 	Major issue in 2.3.18 was fixed, in certain cases blank directory names were written
 	in during dirlog rebuild mode.

 * 19/6/2014 (2.3.18_b1)
 
 	Automake: --enable-precheck does not disable regular (or chrooted) binary build
 
 * 26/5/2014 (2.3.17_beta)
 
 	Now supports gzip compressed data sources, usefull for large
 	imdb/tvrage logs
 
 * 25/5/2014 (2.3.17_beta)
 	Added a way to accumulate (add-up) any integer/floating point field across the whole
 	data source or just a part of it. For example, directory sizes from the dirlog can be
 	added up and stored into one of the available accumulators (see DATA_STRUCTURES).
 	
 	Filters are respected, anything not passing through will be ignored.
 	
 	How and where a value accumulates, is defined via a LOM filter hook;
 	Directives within a LOM command scope, which define the accumulation 
 	process, are not treated as filters and are ignored.
 	
 	Usage examples:
 	
	  Count up folder files and sizes from all dirlog records:
 	
		glutil -d --ilom "u64glob10 += size && u64glob11 += files" --postexec "echo 'Total size: {u64glob10} bytes, files: {u64glob11}'" --silent
 		
	  Increment by one for each record matched (regex and LOM filters applied):
   	  
		glutil -d --ilom "u64glob7 += 1" --iregex "a" --ilom "size != 0 && files != 0" --postexec "echo 'Results: {u64glob7}'"
		
 	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
 	Added -mlist, displays all available macros, with descriptions (if present)
 	
 	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	
 	Added dirlog-record-stats, imdb-record-avgstats, imdb-record-totalstats and imdb-record-stats
 	macros to macros.glutil.
 	
 	See descriptions by running:
 	
		glutil -mlist | egrep "^(imdb|dirlog)-record"
 
 * 23/5/2014
 	Changed behaviour: dirlog rebuild does not skip empty directories unconditionally.
 	Instead, specifiy appropriate filtering parameters (e.g. --lom "size = 0 && files = 0")
 	at the command line when running a dirlog rebuld (-r).
 
 * 17/5/2014
 	Dump operations (-d, -n, ..) and filesystem traversal (-x) no longer output 
 	statistics by default (use '--stats' to revert to old behaviour)
  
 * 5/1/2014
 	Changed option name for full dirlog rebuild from '-f' to '--full' (2.3.10)
 
 * 6/12/2013
 	Converted project to automake and fixed a bug (see ChangeLog)
