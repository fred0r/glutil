 *     (works together with --check)

 *  - Bugfix: --check was processing nuked releases as non-nuked (since 0.6) (rev. 1)
 *  - Bugfix: directory nuke status wasn't read properly from nukelog; in cases when
 *      directory was nuked/unnuked multiple times, multiple records can exist in
 *      nukelog - only last one should be read (rev. 2)

 *      customized settings) (rev .3)

 *  - Code cleanup (rev .4)
 *
 * v0.5:
 *
 *  - Dirlog and nukelog now fully buffers into memory (large performance
 *  	improvement); if data file is larger than DB_MAX_SIZE (--memlimit),
 *  	buffering is not used (-v prints notices about this)
 *  - Added --nobuffer, turns off buffering
 *  - Bugfix: --siteroot didn't have any effect (rev. 2)
 *  - Added --dupechk: looks for duplicate records within dirlog and prints
 *      to stdout (rev. 3)

 *  - Added --memlimit, overrides the default max buffer limit defined by
 *      DB_MAX_SIZE macro (rev. 4)
 *  - Fixed command line args processing to abort & warn when not enough
 *      parameters supplied (rev. 5)
 *  - Added -u, updates dirlog instead of rebuilding it (used with -r) (rev. 6)
 *
 * v0.4:
 *
 *  - Added nukelog read capability
 *  - Bugfix: now sets proper dir status by referencing nukelog,
 *      instead of setting status based on directory nuke labels

 *  - While dumping dirlog (-d), looks up nukelog and prints nuke
 *      stats, if any
 *  - Verification (--check) now takes into account the nukelog:
 *      checks if status flags (dirlog<->nukelog) match,
 *      warns on missing nukelog entries
 *  - Added --help
 *  - Now does full siteroot recursion when .folders file is missing or -f
 *      flag is given (rev. 1)
 *  - Added regex skip filters at dirlog import (PREG_DIR_SKIP macro) (rev. 2)
 *

 *  - Bugfix: dirlog data header was misaligned, added support
 *     	for multiple gl versions (determined by GLVERSION var)
 *  - Bugfix: absolute paths  instead of relative to root set used
 *     	in dirname field of the data header
 *  - Bugfix: nuked dirs imported without proper status set in data
 *  	header
 *  - Added -s option, imports individual folders; use quotation
 *     	marks if adding multiple folders (e.g -s "/dir1 /dir2 /dir3")
 *  - SFV generation, --sfv option when importing will generate
 *     	new sfv files and remove existing ones
 *  - Added --nowrite, acts normally except it does no actual writing
 *  	(including SFV gen)
 *  - Bugfix: on some systems, file type was not recognized properly by
 *  	readdir, instead it now gets info from stat function (rev. 1)
 *  - Bugfix: dirlog data was not displayer properly on 32 bit systems (rev. 2)
 *  - Bugfix: failed creating new backup when one already existed (rev. 3)
 *  - Added --glroot, --siteroot, --dirlog and --folders options (rev. 4)
 *  - .folders file now requires paths relative to siteroot (no / needed in
 *  	front) (rev. 4)
 *  - Requires glconf.h from /bin/sources to determine proper headers, compile from
 *  	that folder or set proper path to glconf.h in dirupdate.c (rev. 4)
 *  - Command line arguments now use '=' with some options (e.g. glroot=/glftpd)
 *  	(rev. 4)
 *  - Stats output on write fixed (was not showing properly or not at all) (rev. 5)
 *  - Output formatting fixed up a bit (rev. 5)
 *  - Bugfix: --check output formatting was broken (rev. 5)
 *  - Bugfix: -f (force) overwrite when doing -s was broken (rev. 6)
 *  - Output formatting fix (rev. 6)
 *  - Various small bugfixes and improvements in all revisions

 *  - Bugfix: directory handles weren't getting cleaned
 *    	up on recursion, hitting max open handle limit.
 *  - Flag parser, easy to add new command line arg options
 *  - Added -r option (recursive dirlog generation), reads
 *    	folders and depths from a file specified by DU_FLD
 *  - Backs up dirlog before modifying it
 *  - Added -v (verbose), -vv (more verbose) and -f
 *    	(force) options
 *  - Added -d (outputs records to stdout, formatted)
 *  - Added --check, compares records in dirlog and filesystem
 *   	and warns on differences
