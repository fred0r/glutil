 General purpose glFTPd binary logs utilitythe same

  This tool aims to provide:

    - A way to clean up any glFTPd binary log and rebuild dirlog based on 
        filesystem data
    - Ability to pass along data from binary logs (and other sources) to the 
        shell for further processing
    - Ability to write any type of binary log data using an ASCII formatted 
        text source
    - Display data (filtered and sorted) from any supported binary log 
        in various formats
  
  Check /scripts folder in this repo for examples on what can be done 
    with this tool. This is a C source project, scripts are NOT required
    for any part of glutil to function.  However, scripts depend on 
    glutil to read/write binary log/shm/filesystem/config data. 
    Scripts are NOT maintained and tested on different evironments. 
    That said, they should work fine on most newer linux environments 
    and provide scripters with a base for porting to theirown select platforms.

  See ./glutil --help for full list of flags with short descriptions.

 INSTALLATION:

  - Unpack and compile:

      tar -xf glutil..tar.bz2
      cd glutil..
      
      cp /glroot/bin/sources/glconf.h src/
      ./configure
      make
      make install

      Some warnings might pop up (should be safe)
      glconf.h (found in /bin/sources) is needed to compile properly,
       make sure it is in 'src/' folder.
       

 MAIN FEATURES:

  - Import individual/missing records or rebuild entire dirlog based 
      on file-system and nukelog data (read below)
  - Rebuild existing binary glFTPd logs (see full list below) 
      using regex/custom filtering methods and sorting
  - Display various binary glFTPd logs (filtered/sorted) in human 
      readable formats
  - Execute external tools/scripts for each data record found, passing 
      along binary data as argument strings to shell (see --exec
      in --help)
  - Extract relevant data from config/users/groups files and pass along
      as argument strings to shell
  - Write to any binary log, using an ASCII formatted text source
  - Compare dirlog data against filesystem/nukelog to spot differences and
      fix them
  - Search for duplicates in dirlog
  - Generate SFV files inside respective folders
