 General purpose glFTPd binary logs utility

  This tool aims to provide:

    - A way to clean up any glFTPd binary log and rebuild dirlog based on 
        filesystem data
    - Ability to pass along data from binary logs (and other sources) to the 
        shell for further processing
    - Ability to write any type of binary log data using an ASCII formatted 
        text source
    - Display data (filtered and sorted) from any supported binary log 
        in various formats
  
  Check /scripts folder in this repo for examples on what can be done 
    with this tool

  See ./glutil --help for full list of flags with short descriptions.

 INSTALLATION:

  - Compile:

      cp glutil.c /<glroot>/bin/sources
      cd /<glroot>/bin/sources
      cc glutil.c -o ../glutil -Wall -O3

      Some warnings might pop up (should be safe)
      glconf.h (found in /bin/sources) is needed to compile properly,
       make sure it is in the same folder or change it's location in 
       glutil.c 
       
  - Placed in /<glroot>/bin/sources, 'installgl.sh' will compile it, 
      since no additional headers are required.

 MAIN FEATURES:

  - Import individual/missing records or rebuild entire dirlog based 
      on file-system and nukelog data (read below)
  - Rebuild existing binary glFTPd logs (see full list below) 
      using regex/custom filtering methods and sorting
  - Display various binary glFTPd logs (filtered/sorted) in human 
      readable formats
  - Execute external tools/scripts for each data record found, passing 
      along binary data as argument strings to shell (see --exec
      in --help)
  - Extract relevant data from config/users/groups files and pass along
      as argument strings to shell
  - Write to any binary log, using an ASCII formatted text source
  - Compare dirlog data against filesystem/nukelog to spot differences and
      fix them
  - Search for duplicates in dirlog
  - Generate SFV files inside respective folders
