 General purpose glFTPd binary logs utility

  This tool serves as an I/O mechanism between user's scripts and 
  binary logs and online users data from the shared memory segment.
  Additionally, it can traverse a filesystem directory tree much the
  same way as it would other sources, honoring all of the the extensive 
  filtering options available, making it a powerfull filesystem search 
  application.
      
  Check /scripts folder in this repo for examples on what can be done 
    with this tool. This is a C source project, scripts are NOT required
    for any part of glutil to function.  However, scripts depend on 
    glutil to read/write binary log/shm/filesystem/config data. 
    Scripts are NOT maintained and tested on different evironments. 
    That said, they should work fine on most newer linux environments 
    and provide scripters with a base for porting to theirown select platforms.

  See ./glutil --help for full list of options with short descriptions.

 MAIN FEATURES:

  - Import individual/missing records or rebuild entire dirlog based 
      on file-system and nukelog data (read below)
  - Rebuild existing binary glFTPd logs (see full list below) 
      using regex/custom filtering methods and sorting
  - Display various binary glFTPd logs/online users/config data 
      (filtered/sorted) using custom formatting and pre-processing
      hooks (-print, -execv)
  - Execute external tools/scripts for each data record matched, passing 
      along argument strings converted from binary data to shell (-execv)
  - Write to any binary log, using an ASCII formatted text or binary 
  	  source
  - Calculate CRC32 hashes

 INSTALLATION:

  - Unpack and compile:

      git clone https://github.com/nixnodes/glutil.git      
      cp /glroot/bin/sources/glconf.h src/
      ./configure --prefix=/glroot
      make
      
      Some warnings might pop up (should be safe)
      glconf.h (found in /bin/sources) is needed to compile properly,
      make sure to put it into 'src/' folder.
      
  - Install:
      
      make install
