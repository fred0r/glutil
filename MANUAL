glutil can perform IO operations on glFTPd binary logs (any vanilla 
binary file you can find in /logs folder), based on advanced filtering 
methods. Aside from that, it has 'hooks' which you can use to capture 
data from binary logs and pass it to the shell. 

Log's <field>'s are referenced using static variable names.

Variable names are accepted by --[i]regex[i], --[i]match, --[i]lom, 
 --sort and --[pre|post|loop]exec  (see --help)

Mind, that whenever passing arguments to --[..]exec, {} needs to be
used around variables ({dir}, {time}, ...) 

Types are:
 
  S = string
  I = integer
  F = float
